npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css -o ./style.css --watch

Example Workflow
Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your theme directory to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Build CSS
For production builds (minified output):

bash

npm run build:css
Watch for Changes
During development, run:
