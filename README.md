npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css -o ./style.css --watch

Example Workflow
Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your theme directory to install the dependencies:

#bash
npm install
Build CSS

For production builds (minified output):
#bash
npm run build:css
Watch for Changes

During development, run:
#bash
npm run watch:css
This will watch your tailwind.css and recompile automatically when you save changes.
